Create a new folder on your local system and your github account called "devops-stuff"
Navigate into the folder and run git pull .....to pull the Lab1.txt file into your local machine
Open the Lab1.txt file in VScode editor and follow instructions to finish the lab.(Not all steps are listed, use Google)

Create a keypair by running the command "ssh-keygen"
Enter the file name "server-pub" when prompted (this is will generate a public and a private ssh key)
NB: No passphrase is required
Using the cat command copy the content of the public ssh key created

Create a file called main.tf and paste the text below(paste the content of your public key inside the parameter "public_key")
resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  ami = "ami-0b0dcb5067f052a63"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    "Name" = "My-Server"
    Description = "Company Server"
  }
  key_name = "server-pub"
}
resource "aws_key_pair" "server-pub" {
  key_name = "server-pub"
  public_key = "paste the content of your public key"
  }

output publicip {
  value = aws_instance.server.public_ip
}

Run command "terraform init"
"terraform plan"
"terraform apply"
NB: Login into the AWS console, go the EC2 dashboard, key pairs and observe what the terraform template configured.
The public ip address of your server will be displayed on the screen, use this to connect to your server

Connect into your server using the private key using the command below
sudo ssh -i server-pub ec2-user@<public-ip-address>

Create user the intern (Joe) with non-interactive shell
Create the staff Nick and Steph as regular users and assign them a password

Verification
Run the command id <username> to verify you have created each user- send screenshot
Run command cat /etc/passwd | grep <username> and send screenshot to verify the user access assigned- send screenshot
Once verified run "terraform destroy"

Update the txt file with extra steps and push to your personal devops-stuff repo to your remote repo.
